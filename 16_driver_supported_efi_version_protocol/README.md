# 16 Driver Supported EFI Version Protocol

The Driver Supported EFI Version Protocol allows a UEFI Driver to specify the
version of the _UEFI Specification_ it follows. The version information follows
the same format as the _Revision_ field in the `EFI_TABLE_HEADER` of the EFI
System Table. This feature is _required_ for UEFI Drivers on PCI and other plug
in cards, but is only _recommended_ for all UEFI Drivers.
