### 3.9.3 Environment variables

Device paths are also used when certain environment variables are built and
stored in non-volatile storage. There are a number of environment variables
defined in the Boot Manager chapter of the _UEFI Specification_. These
variables define the following:

* Console input devices

* Console output devices

* Standard error devices

* The drivers that need to be loaded prior to an OS boot

* The boot selections that the platform supports

The UEFI boot manager, UEFI utilities, and UEFI-conformant operating systems
manage these environment variables as operating systems are installed and
removed from a platform.
