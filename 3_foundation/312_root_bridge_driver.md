## 3.12 Root Bridge Driver

A root bridge driver does not produce any instances of the

`EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL`. It is responsible for initializing and
immediately creating physical controller handles for the root bridge
controllers or root devices in a platform. The driver must install the Device
Path Protocol onto a physical controller handle because the root bridge
controllers or root devices represent physical devices. An example root bridge
driver, `PcAtChipsetPkg/PciHostBridgeDxe`, is shown in the EDK II.

This driver also installs the PCI Root Bridge I/O Protocolâ€•the protocol
abstraction for a PCI Bus. This protocol is used by a bus driver for the PCI
Bus to enumerate the PCI controllers attached to the PCI root bridge.

A driver for a root device may produce a protocol that is more directly usable
as a console or boot device. For example, a Serial I/O Protocol for a serial
device that is not attached to an industry standard bus type supported by the
_UEFI Specification_, or a Block I/O Protocol for a block-oriented media device
that is not attached to an industry standard bus type supported by the _UEFI
Specification._
