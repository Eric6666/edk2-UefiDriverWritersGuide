### 3.8.1 Defining priority

Notification functions at higher priorities can interrupt the execution of
notification functions executing at a lower priority.

The mechanism for defining the priority (in which notification functions are
executed), is used only when more than one event is in the signaled state at
the same time. In these cases, the notification function that has been
registered with the higher priority is executed first.
