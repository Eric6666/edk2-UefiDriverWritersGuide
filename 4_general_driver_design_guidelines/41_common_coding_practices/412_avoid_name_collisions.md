### 4.1.2 Avoid Name Collisions

Compilers and linkers guarantee that there are no function name or global
variable name collisions within a single UEFI Driver, but the compilers and
linkers cannot check for function name or global variable name collisions
between UEFI Drivers. This inability to check is a concern when debuggers are
used that can perform source-level debugging or can display function names.
_Appendix A_ contains source code templates that help avoid function name
collisions between UEFI Drivers by using the name of the driver in the function
names.
