### 4.2.12 Design to be re-entrant

Design all UEFI Drivers to manage multiple controllers. This requires that the
controller specific information be managed in its own data structure. The
practical manifestation of this requirement is that all the data that must be
local to the instance (context) of the protocol must **not** be stored in global
variables. Instead, collect data into a private context data structure so that
each time an I/O protocol installs onto a handle, a new version of the
structure is allocated from memory. This concept is described in detail in
_Chapter 8_ of this guide.
