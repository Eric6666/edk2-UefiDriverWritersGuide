### 4.2.18 Offer alternatives to function keys

Configuration of drivers should be accomplished via HII and via OS-present
interfaces.

There are design considerations when interacting outside of configuration.
First, consider using the setup interface as the user interface for a UEFI
driver. The user already understands the interface and remote use is already
enabled. If the existing high level interfaces cannot be used, then follow the
design considerations for using console based services.

UEFI drivers should use the console input services (see _Section 22.2_ of this
guide), and then be aware of alternatives to function keys. This is because the
UEFI console may be connected through a serial port. In such cases, it is
sensitive to the correct terminal emulator configuration. If the terminal
emulator is not correctly configured to match the terminal settings in UEFI (PC
ANSI, VT100, VT100+, or VT-UTF8), some of the keys (function keys, arrow keys
(page up/down, insert/delete, and backspace), may not work correctly, display
colors properly nor render the correct cursor positioning.

**********
**Note:** _To better support users, it is recommended that UEFI configuration
protocols and UEFI applications create user interfaces that are not solely
dependent on these keys but instead offer alternatives for these keys._
**********
**Note:** _It is important to be aware that the Simple Input Protocol does not
support the CTRL or ALT keys because these keys are not available with remote
terminals such as terminal emulators and telnet._
**********

The following table shows one possible set of alternate key sequences for
function keys, arrow keys, page up/down keys, and the insert/delete keys. Each
configuration protocol and application decides if alternate key sequences are
supported and which alternate mappings should be used. The table also lists the
UEFI scan code from the Simple Input Protocol and the alternate key sequence to
use to produce particular scan codes.

Most of these key sequences are directly supported in the EDK II_â€•_special
handling is not required to support these key sequences on a remote terminal.
Those labeled as "No" are not directly supported in the EDK II. They are parsed
and interpreted by the configuration protocol or application.
