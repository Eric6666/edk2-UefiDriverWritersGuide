In addition, the parameters for the serial port on the "target" system (the
system under test) must be setup correctly, including baud rate, data bits,
stop bits, and flow control. The settings on the target system must match the
settings on the host system that is receiving the debug data. The EDK II
includes sample code for serial port debug output for the PEI phase, in the MDE
module package. The MDE module package also includes sample code for serial
port debug output for the DXE phase
