### 6.2.7 Bus drivers that produce all children in Start()

If a bus driver is always required to enumerate all of its child devices, then
the _RemainingDevicePath_ parameter should be ignored in the `Supported()` and
`Start()` services of the `EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL`. All of the child
handles should be produced in the first call to `Start()`.
