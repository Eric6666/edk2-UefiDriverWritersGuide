# 32 Distributing UEFI Drivers

Once a UEFI Driver is implemented and validated and ready to be released, there
are only a few ways that the UEFI Driver can be installed onto a target
platform. These include:

* PCI Option ROM on a PCI add-in card.

* Integrated into the platform firmware FLASH image.

* A file in an EFI System Partition.
