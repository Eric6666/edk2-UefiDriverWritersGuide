### 5.3.17 Exit()

The `Exit()` service is typically only used by UEFI applications. UEFI drivers
usually have simple driver entry point implementations and typically return an
`EFI_STATUS` code from their entry point function. This is the recommended
style for UEFI driver implementations. If `EFI_SUCCESS` is returned by a UEFI
driver, then the UEFI driver remains loaded in system memory. If an error
status is returned, then the UEFI driver is unloaded from system memory.

The `Exit()` service allows a UEFI image to exit without having to return an
`EFI_STATUS` value from the UEFI image's entry point. A UEFI driver with more
complex logic in its entry point may discover a condition that requires the
UEFI driver to exit immediately. In this rare condition, the `Exit()` service
could be used. However, the UEFI driver implementation must take care to free
any allocated resources and uninstall all protocols before returning an error
code through the `Exit()` service. The following example shows how the `Exit()`
service could be used by a UEFI driver to exit with a status code of
`EFI_UNSUPPORTED`. The EDK II library `UefiBootServicesTableLib` provides the
global `gBS`―a pointer to the UEFI Boot Services Table and `gImageHandle`―the
Image Handle of the currently executing UEFI image.

###### Example 85-Exit from a UEFI Driver

```c
#include <Uefi.h>
#include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>

//
// Exit the current UEFI image with a status of EFI_UNSUPPORTED
//
gBS->Exit (gImageHandle, EFI_UNSUPPORTED, 0, NULL);
```
