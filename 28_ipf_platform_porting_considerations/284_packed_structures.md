## 28.4 Packed Structures

The following example shows another example that generates an alignment fault
on an IPF platform. The first read access from _MyStructure.First_ always works
because the 8-bit value is always aligned. However, the second read access from
_MyStructure.Second_ always fails because the 32-bit value is never aligned on
a 4-byte boundary.

###### Example 245-Packed structure alignment fault

```c
#include <Uefi.h>

#pragma pack(1)
typedef struct {
  UINT8  First;
  UINT32 Second;
} MY_STRUCTURE;
#pragma pack()

MY_STRUCTURE MyStructure;
UINT8        FirstValue;
UINT32       SecondValue;

//
// Works
//
FirstValue   = MyStructure.First;

//
// Fails. Generates an alignment fault
//
SecondValue  = MyStructure.Second;
```

The next example shows the same example as Example 245, above, but has been
modified to prevent the alignment fault. The second read access from
_MyStructure.Second_ is replaced with a call to the EDK II library `BaseLib`
function called `ReadUnaligned32()` that treats the 32-bit value as an array of
bytes. The individual bytes are read and combined into a 32-bit value. The
generated object code is larger and slower, but it is functional on all CPU
architectures supported by the _UEFI Specification_.

###### Example 246-Corrected packed structure alignment fault

```c
#include <Uefi.h>
#include <Library/BaseLib.h>

#pragma pack(1)
typedef struct {
  UINT8 First;
  UINT32 Second;
} MY_STRUCTURE;
#pragma pack()

MY_STRUCTURE  MyStructure;
UINT8         FirstValue;
UINT32        SecondValue;

//
// Works
//
FirstValue  = MyStructure.First;

//
// Works
//
SecondValue = ReadUnaligned32 ((VOID *)&MyStructure.Second);
```

If a data structure is copied from one location to another, then both the
source and the destination pointers for the copy operation should be aligned on
a 64-bit boundary. The EDK II library `BaseMemoryLib` provides the `CopyMem()`
service that handles unaligned copy operations, so an alignment fault is never
generated by the copy operation itself.

However, if the fields of the data structure at the destination location are
accessed, they may generate alignment faults if the destination address is not
aligned on a 64-bit boundary. There are cases where an aligned structure may be
copied to an unaligned destination, but the fields of the destination buffer
must not be accessed after the copy operation is completed. An example of this
case is when a packed data structure is built and stored on a mass storage
device or transmitted on a network.
