## 29.5 Natural Integers and Fixed Size Integers

UEFI Drivers should only use the integer data types defined in the Calling
Conventions section of the _UEFI Specification_. Even when this recommendation
is followed, there is an additional limitation of the EBC architecture. UEFI
Drivers with arithmetic calculations and comparisons between following integer
types must be avoided:

* `INTN` and `UINT8`

* `INTN` and `UINT16`

* `INTN` and `UINT32`

* `UINTN` and `INT64`
