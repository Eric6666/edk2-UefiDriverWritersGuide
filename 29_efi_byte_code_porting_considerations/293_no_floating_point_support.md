## 29.3 No Floating Point Support

There is no floating-point support in the EBC virtual machine, which means that
the type `float` is not supported by the Intel(R) C Compiler for EFI Byte Code.
If a UEFI Driver is being ported to EBC and the UEFI Driver uses floating-point math,
then the UEFI Driver must be converted to use fixed-point math based on integer
operands and operators.
