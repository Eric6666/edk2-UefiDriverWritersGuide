## 30.4 Adding a UEFI Driver to DSC File

The list of UEFI Drivers that need to be built must be added to the
`[Components]` section of a DSC file. Once a UEFI Driver has been added to the
`[Components]` section, an attempt is made to build the UEFI Driver every time
the EDK II build tool called `build.exe` is invoked with the appropriate
parameters.

This example shows the same example DSC file `MyDriverPkg/MyDriverPkg.dsc`,
except it has now been updated to list `MyDriverPkg/MyDriver/MyDriver.inf` in
the `[Components]` section.
